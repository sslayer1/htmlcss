                    <p>Go West are an English pop duo, formed in 1982 by lead vocalist Peter Cox and 
                        rhythm guitarist and backup vocalist Richard Drummie. The duo enjoyed their 
                        peak of popularity between the mid 1980s and the early 1990s and are best known 
                        for the international top 10 hits "We Close Our Eyes", "Call Me", and 
                        "King of Wishful Thinking".<br><br>
                        They were named Best British Newcomer at the 1986 Brit Awards. Go West had a 
                        publishing deal and possessed a portastudio, but lacked a band or recording company. 
                        Cox and Drummie decided, with support from John Glover, their manager, to find 
                        a musical producer, and record just two of their songs.
                        The tracks "We Close Our Eyes" and "Call Me" found Go West landing
                        a recording contract with Chrysalis Records. Upon confirmation
                        of the Chrysalis deal, they recruited British guitarist Alan Murphy, 
                        whose contributions became a key ingredient in shaping the duo's musical
                        identity.
                        Go West's debut single, "We Close Our Eyes", was released in 1985
                        and reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 5 on the US Dance Club Play chart 
                        and No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100.[4][5] The video for the song, directed by 
                        Godley & Creme, became an early favourite on MTV.
                        "We Close Our Eyes" would prove to be the band's highest-placed UK single, 
                        and their only appearance in the UK top ten.<br> <br>                     
                        The duo's eponymous debut album was released in 1985. It included 
                        "We Close Our Eyes" and "Call Me" as well as "Don't Look Down", 
                        which served as the prequel to what would be their first top 40 hit in the US. 
                        The album peaked at no. 8 in the United Kingdom and at no. 60 in the United States.<br><br>                        
                        Bangs and Crashes, an album of remixes, B-sides and live tracks, was released in 1986, 
                        and included the track "One Way Street" which was part of the Rocky IV soundtrack. 
                        "Don't Be Afraid of Your Dreams" was in the film A Nightmare on Elm 
                        Street 4: The Dream Master during the closing credits.<br><br>
                        Go West was voted "Best Newcomer" at the 1986 Brit Awards.<br><br>
